CHAPTER I.
</p>

<p>
It was towards the close of a September day.
Old Gregor and his grandson Sasha were
returning home through the forest with their
bundles of wood, the old man stooping low under
the weight of the heavier pieces he carried, while
the boy dragged his great bunch of twigs and
splints by a rope drawn over his shoulder.
Where the trees grew thick the air was already
quite gloomy, but in the open spaces they could
see the sky and tell how near it was to sunset.
</p>

<p>
Both were silent, for they were tired, and it is
not easy to talk and carry a heavy load at the
same time.  But presently something gray appeared
through the trees at the foot of a low hill;
it was the rock where they always rested on
their way home.  Old Gregor laid down his
bundle there, and wiped his face on the sleeve of
his brown jacket, but Sasha sprang upon the
rock and began to balance himself upon one foot,
as was his habit whenever he tried to think
about anything.
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather," he said at last, "why should all
this forest belong to the baron, and none of it to
you?"
</p>

<p>
Gregor looked at him sharply for a moment
before he answered.
</p>

<p>
"It was his father's and his grandfather's: it
has been the property of the family for many a
hundred years, and we never had any."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, grandfather," said Sasha.  "But
why did it come so at <i>first</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Gregor shook his head.  "You might as well
ask how the world was made."  Then, seeing
that the boy looked troubled, he added in a
kinder tone, "Sasha, what put such a thought
into your head?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the forest itself!" replied the boy.  "The
baron lets us have the top branches and little
twigs, but he takes all the great logs and
trunks, and sells them for money.  I know all
the trees, and he does not; I can find my way
in the woods anywhere, and there's many a tree
that would say to me, if it could talk, 'I'd rather
belong to you, Sasha, than to the baron, because
I know you, and I don't know him.'"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, and the moon would say the same to
you, boy, and the sun and the stars, maybe.
You might as well want to own them&mdash;and you
don't even belong to yourself!"
</p>

<p>
Gregor's words seemed harsh and fierce, but
his voice was very sad.  The boy looked at him
and knew not what to say, but his heart beat
violently.  All at once he heard a rustle among
the dead leaves, and a sound as if of footsteps
approaching.  The old man took hold of his
grandson's arm, and made a sign for him to be
silent.  The sound came nearer and nearer, and
presently they could distinguish some dusky
object moving towards them through the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a robber?" whispered the boy.
</p>

<p>
"It is not a man, unless he uses his knees for
hind feet.  I see his head; it is a bear.  Keep
quiet, boy! make no noise: take this stick, but
hold it at your side as I do mine.  If he comes
close, look him firmly in the face; and if I tell
you to strike, hit him on the end of the nose."
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a full-grown bear, marching
slowly on his great flat feet.  He was not more
than thirty yards distant when he saw them, and
stopped.  Both kept their eyes fixed upon his
head, but did not move.  Then he came a few
paces nearer, and Sasha tried hard not to show
that he was trembling inwardly, more, however,
from excitement than fear.  The bear gazed
steadily at them for what seemed a long time,
and there was an expression of anger, but also of
stupid bewilderment, in his eyes.  Finally he
gave a sniff and a grunt, tossed up his nose, and
walked slowly on, stopping once or twice to turn
and look back before he disappeared from view.
Sasha lifted his stick and shook it at him.  He
felt that he should never again be much afraid of
bears.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boy," said his grandfather, "you have
learned how to face danger.  I have been as
near to a loaded cannon as to that bear, and the
wind of the ball threw me upon my face: but I
was up the next moment, and then the gunner
went down!  Our colonel saw it, and I remember
what he said&mdash;ay, every word!  He would
have kept his promise, but we carried him from
the field next day, and that was the end of the
matter.  It was in France that it happened."
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather," asked the boy suddenly, "are
there forests in France, and do they belong to
barons?"
</p>

<p>
"Pick up your faggot, boy, and come along!"
said Gregor.  "It will be dark before we get to
the village, and the potatoes are cooked by this
time."
</p>

<p>
The mention of the potatoes revived all Sasha's
forgotten hunger, and he obeyed in silence.
After walking for a mile as rapidly as their
loads would permit them, they issued from the
forest, and saw the wooden houses of the village
on a green knoll, in the last gleams of sunset.
The church, with its three little copper-covered
domes, stood on the highest point.  Next to it
the priest's house and garden, and then began the
broad street, lined with square log-cabins and
adjoining stables, sloping down to a large
pond, at the foot of which was a mill.  Beyond
the water there was a great stretch of grazing
meadow, then long rolling fields of rye and
barley, extending to the woods which bounded
the view in every direction.  The village was
situated within a few miles of the great main
highway running from Warsaw to Moscow, and
the waters of the lake fed the stream which
flowed into one of the branches of the river
Dnieper.
</p>

<p>
The whole region, including the village and
nearly all the people in it, belonged to the estate
of Baron Popoff, the roofs of whose residence
were just visible to the southward, on a hill
overlooking the road to Moscow.  The former
castle had been entirely destroyed during the
retreat of Bonaparte's army, and the baron's
grandfather suffered so many losses at the time,
that he was only able to build a large and very
plain modern house; but the people continued to
call it the "Castle" or "Palace," just as before.
</p>

<p>
Although the baron sold every year great
quantities of timber, grain, hemp and wool from
his estates, he always seemed to be in want of
money.  The servants who went with him every
year to St. Petersburg were very discreet, and
said little about their master's habits of life; but
the people understood, somehow, that he often
lost large sums by gambling.  This gave them
a good deal of uneasiness, for if he should be
obliged to part with the estate, they would all be
transferred with it to a new owner&mdash;and this
might be one who had other estates in a different
part of the country, to which he could send them
if he was so minded.
</p>

<p>
At the time of which we are writing twenty-two
millions of the Russian people were serfs.
Their labour, even their property, belonged to the
owner of the land upon which they lived.  The
latter had not the power to sell them to another,
as was formerly the case in the Southern States
of America, but he could remove them from one
estate to another if he had several.  Baron Popoff
was a haughty and indifferent master, but not a
cruel one; the people of the village had belonged
to his family for several generations, and were
accustomed to their condition.  At least, they
saw no way of changing it, except by a change of
masters, which was more likely to be a misfortune
than a benefit.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly dark when old Gregor and his
grandson threw down their loads and entered the
house.  The supper was already waiting, for
Sasha's sister, little Minka, had been up to the
church door to see whether they were coming.
In one corner of the room a tiny lamp was
burning before a picture of the Virgin Mary and
Child Jesus, all covered with gilded brass except
the hands and faces, which were nearly black,
partly from the smoke, and partly because the
common Russian people imagine that the Hebrews
were a very dark-skinned race.  Sasha's father,
Ivan, had also lighted a long pine-splint, and the
room looked very cheerful.  The boiled potatoes
were smoking in a great wooden bowl, beside
which stood a dish of salt, another of melted fat,
and a loaf of black bread.  They had neither
plates, knives nor forks, only some coarse wooden
spoons, and all ate out of the bowl, after the salt
had been sprinkled and the fat poured over the
potatoes.  For drink there was an earthen pitcher
of quass, a kind of thin and rather sour beer.
</p>

<p>
Old Gregor sat on one side of the table, and
his son Ivan with Anna, his wife, opposite.
There were five children, the eldest being
Alexander (whom we know by his nickname "Sasha,"
which is the Russian for "Aleck" or "Sandy"),
then Minka, Peter, Waska, and Sergius.  Sasha
was about thirteen years old, rather small for his
age, and hardly to be called a handsome boy.
Only there was something very pleasant in his
large gray eyes, and his long, thick flaxen hair
shone almost like silver when the sun fell upon
it.  However, he never thought about his looks.
When he went to the village bath-house, on a
Saturday evening, to take his steam-bath with
the rest, the men would sometimes say, after
examining his joints and muscles, "You are going
to be strong, Sasha!"&mdash;and that was as much as
he cared to know about himself.
</p>

<p>
The boy was burning with desire to tell the
adventure with the bear, but he did not like to
speak before his grandfather, and there was
something in the latter's eye which made him
feel that he was watching him.  Gregor first
lighted his pipe, and then, in the coolest manner
possible&mdash;as if it were something that happened
every day&mdash;related the story.
</p>

<p>
"Pity I hadn't your gun with me, Ivan," he
said at the close; "what with the meat, the fat,
and the skin, we should have had thirty roubles."
</p>

<p>
The children were quite noisy with excitement.
Little Peter said, "What for did you let him go,
Sasha?  I'd have killed him, and carried him
home!"  Then all laughed so heartily that Peter
began to cry, and was soon packed into a box in
the corner, where he was soon as fast asleep as
ever was the proverbial door-nail.
</p>

<p>
"Take the gun with you to-morrow, father."
said Ivan.
</p>

<p>
"It's too much with my load of wood,"
answered the old man.  "The old hunting-knife
is all I want.  Sasha will stand by me with a
club: I don't think he'll be afraid next time."
</p>

<p>
Sasha was about to exclaim, "I was not afraid
the first time!" but before he spoke it flashed
across his mind that he did tremble a little;
but he consoled himself a little that it was not
from fear.
</p>

<p>
By this time it was dark outside.  Two pine-splints
had burned out, one after the other, and
only the little lamp before the shrine enabled
those present to see each other.  The old people
went to bed in their narrow rooms, which were
hardly better than closets; and Sasha, spreading
a coarse sack of straw on the floor, lay down,
covering himself with his sheepskin coat, and in
five minutes was so sound asleep that he might
have been dragged about by the heels without
being awakened.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CHAPTER II.
</p>

<p>
Next day in the forest old Gregor worked
more rapidly than usual.  He spoke very
little, in spite of Sasha's eagerness to talk,
and kept the boy so busy that all the wood was
gathered up and made into bundles two or three
hours before the usual time.
</p>

<p>
They were in a partially cleared spot, near the
top of some rising ground.  The old man looked
at the sky, nodded his head, and said with a
satisfied air, "We have plenty of time left for
ourselves, Sasha; come with me, and I'll show
you something."
</p>

<p>
Gregor then set out in a direction opposite
from home, and the boy, who expected nothing
less than the finding of another bear, seized a
tough straight club, and followed him.  They
went for nearly a mile over rolling ground
through the forest, and then descended into a
narrow glen, at the foot of which ran a rapid
stream.  Very soon rocks began to appear on
both sides, and the glen became a chasm where
there was barely room to walk.  It was a cold,
gloomy, strange place; Sasha had never seen
anything like it.  He felt a singular creeping of
the flesh, but not for the world would he have
turned back.
</p>

<p>
The path ceased, and there was a waterfall in
front filling up the whole chasm.  Gregor pulled
off his boots and stepped into the stream, which
reached nearly to his knees; he gave his hand to
Sasha, who could hardly have walked alone
against the force of the current.  They reached
the foot of the fall, the spray of which was
whirled into their faces.  Then Gregor turned
suddenly to the left, passed through the thin
edge of the falling water, and Sasha, pulled after
him, found himself in a low arched vault of rock,
into which the light shone down from another
opening.  They crawled upwards on hands and
knees, and came out into a great circular hole, like
a kettle, through the middle of which ran the
stream.  There was no other way of getting
into it, for the rocks leaned inward as they rose,
making the bottom considerably wider than the
top.
</p>

<p>
On one side, under the middle of the rocky
arch, stood a square black stone about five feet
high, with a circle of seven smaller stones
resembling seats around it.  Sasha was dumb with
surprise at finding himself in such a wonderful
spot.
</p>

<p>
But old Gregor made the sign of the cross, and
muttered something which seemed to be like a
prayer.  Then he went to the black stone, and
put his hand upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Sasha," he said, "this is one of the places
where the old Russian people came many thousand
years ago, before ever the name of Christ
was heard of.  They were dreadful heathens
in those days, and this place was what served
them for a church.  A black stone had to be the
altar, because they had a black god, who was
never satisfied unless they fed him with human
flesh."
</p>

<p>
"Where is the black god now?" asked Sasha.
</p>

<p>
"They say he has turned into an evil spirit,
and is hiding somewhere in the wilderness; but
I cannot say for the truth of it.  His name was
Perun.  Most men do not care to say it, but I
have the courage, because I've been a soldier and
have an honest conscience.  Are you afraid to
stand here?" asked Gregor inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Not if you are not, grandfather," answered
Sasha, bravely but respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"If your heart were bad and false, Sasha, you
would have reason to be afraid; but as I know
it is not, you can come here without fear of
danger."
</p>

<p>
Sasha obeyed.  The old man opened the boy's
coarse shirt and laid his hand upon his heart;
then he made him do the same to himself, so that
the heart of each beat directly against the hand
of the other.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boy," said Gregor, after a pause, "I am
going to trust you, and if you say a word you do
not mean, or think otherwise than you speak, I
shall feel it in the motion of your heart.  Do you
know the difference between a serf and a
free-man?  Would you rather live like your father,
having nothing that he can call his own, or would
you live like the Baron Popoff, with wealth,
and houses, and lands, and forests, and people,
that no one could take from you, except, perhaps,
the emperor?"
</p>

<p>
Sasha's heart gave a great thump before he
could open his mouth.  The old man smiled, and
he said to himself, "I was right."  Then he
continued: "I should be a free man now, if our
colonel had lived.  Your father had not wit and
courage enough to try, but you can do it, Sasha,
if you think of nothing else and work for nothing
else.  I will help you all I can; but you must
begin at once.  Will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, grandfather, yes!" exclaimed Sasha
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Promise me that you will say nothing to
any living person; that you will obey me and
remember all I say to you while I live, and be
none the less faithful to the purpose when I am
dead!"
</p>

<p>
Sasha promised everything at once.  After a
moment's silence Gregor took his hand from the
boy's breast, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you truly mean it.  The people of old
used to say that if any one broke a promise made
before this stone, the black heathen god would
have power over him."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the bear was the black god,"
suggested Sasha.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he was.  Look him in the face, as
you did yesterday, remember your promise, and
he can't harm you."
</p>

<p>
As they walked back slowly through the
forest Gregor began to talk, and the boy kept
close beside him, listening eagerly to every word.
</p>

<p>
"The first thing, Sasha," said he, "is to get
knowledge.  You must learn, somehow, to read
and write, and count figures.  I must tell you all
I know, about everything in the world, but that's
very little; and it is so mixed up in my head that
I don't rightly know where to begin.  It's a
blessing I have not forgotten much; what I
picked up I held on to, and now I see the reason
why.  There's nothing you can't use, if you wait
long enough."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about France!" cried Sasha.
</p>

<p>
"France and Germany too!  I was two or
three years, off and on, in those foreign parts,
and I could talk smartly in the speech of
both&mdash;<i>Allez!  Sortez!  Donnez moi du vin!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Gregor stopped and straightened his bent back;
his eyes flashed, and he laughed long and heartily.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Allez!  Sortez!  Donnez moi du vin!</i>"
repeated Sasha.
</p>

<p>
Gregor caught up the boy in his arms and
kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"The very thing, Sasha!" he cried.  "I'll teach
you both tongues,&mdash;and all about the strange
habits of the people, their houses, and churches,
and which way the battle went, and what queer
harness they have on their horses, and a talking
bird I once saw, and a man that kept a bottle
full of lightning in his room, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
So his tongue ran on.  It was a great delight
to him to recall his memories of more than thirty
years, and he was constantly surprised to find
how many little things that seemed forgotten
came back to his mind.  Sasha's breath came
quick as he listened; his whole body felt warm
and nimble, and it suddenly seemed to him
possible to learn anything and everything.
Before reaching home he had fixed twenty or
thirty French words in his memory.  There they
were, hard and tight; he knew he should never
forget them.
</p>

<p>
From that day began a new life for both.  Old
Gregor's method of instruction would simply
have confused a pupil less ignorant and eager to
be taught; but Sasha was so sure that knowledge
would in some way help him to become a free
man, that he seized upon everything he heard.
In a few months he knew as much German and
French as his grandfather, and when they were
alone they always spoke, as much as possible, in
one or the other language.  But the boy's greatest
desire was to learn how to read.  During the
following winter he made himself useful to the
priest in various ways, and finally succeeded in
getting from him the letters of the alphabet and
learning how to put them together.  Of course
he could not keep secret all that he did; it
was enough that no one guessed his object in
doing it.
</p>

<p>
One day in the spring, just after the baron
had returned with his wife from St. Petersburg,
Sasha was sent on an errand to the castle.  He
was bare-headed and bare-footed; his shirt and
wide trousers were very coarse, but clean, and
his hair floated over his shoulders like a mass of
shining silk.  When he reached the castle the
baron and baroness, with a strange lady, were
sitting in the balcony.  The latter said, in French,
"There's a nice-looking boy!"
</p>

<p>
Sasha was so glad to find that he understood,
and so delighted with the remark, that he looked
up suddenly and blushed.
</p>

<p>
"I really believe he understands what I said,"
exclaimed the lady.
</p>

<p>
The baron laughed.  "Do you suppose my
young serfs are educated like princes?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"If he were so intelligent as that, how long could
I keep him?"
</p>

<p>
Sasha bent down his head, and kicked the
loose pebbles with his feet to hide his excitement.
The blood was humming in his ears: the baron
had said the same thing as his grandfather had
said&mdash;to get knowledge was the only way to get
freedom!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CHAPTER III.
</p>

<p>
The summer passed away, and the second
autumn came.  Gregor had told all he
knew; told it twice, three times; and
Sasha, more eager than ever, began to grow
impatient for something more.  He had secured
a little reading-book, such as is used for children,
and studied it until he knew the exact place of
every letter in it, but there was no one to give
the poor boy another volume, or to teach him any
further.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, as he was returning alone from
a neighbouring village by a country road which
branched off from the main highway, he saw
three men sitting on the bank under the edge of
a thicket.  They were strangers, and they seemed
to him to be foreigners.  Two were of middle
age, with harsh, evil faces; the third was young,
and had an anxious frightened look.  They were
talking earnestly, but before he could distinguish
the words, one of them saw him, made a sign to
the others, and then he was very sure that they
suddenly changed their language; for it was
German he now heard.
</p>

<p>
He felt proud of his own knowledge, and his
first thought was to say "Good-day!" in
German.  Then he remembered his grandfather's
counsel, "Never display your knowledge until
there is a good reason for it," and gave his
greeting in Russian.  The young man nodded
his head in return; the others took no notice
of him.  But in passing he understood these
sentences:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He will carry a great deal of money....
There's no danger&mdash;he will be alone....
Grain and hemp both sold to-day....  It
will be already dark."
</p>

<p>
Just beyond the thicket the road made a sharp
turn and entered the woods.  Sasha never afterwards
could quite explain the impulse which led
him to dart under the trees as soon as he
was out of sight, to get in the rear of the
thicket, crawl silently nearer on his hands and
knees, and then lie down flat within hearing of
the men's voices.  For a moment he was overcome
with a horrible fear.  They were silent, and his
heart beat so loudly that he thought they could
no more help noticing it than the sound of a
blacksmith's hammer.
</p>

<p>
Presently one of them spoke, this time in
Russian.
</p>

<p>
"There is a hill from which you can see both
roads," he said, "but he'll hardly take the highway."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure his groom was not in the town
along with him?" asked another.
</p>

<p>
"It's all as I say&mdash;rely upon that!" was the
answer.  "For all his titles he's no more than
another man, and we are three!"
</p>

<p>
In talking further they mentioned the name
of the town; it was the place only a few miles
distant where the grain, hemp, and other products
of the estate were sold to traders&mdash;and this was
the day of the sale!  The plot of the robbers
flashed into Sasha's mind; and if he had had any
remaining doubts, they were soon removed by
his hearing the name of Baron Popoff mentioned.
The latter was to be waylaid, plundered, killed
if he resisted.  Then the eldest of the three men
said, as he got up from the bank where they had
been sitting:
</p>

<p>
"We must be on the way.  Better be too early
than too late."
</p>

<p>
"But it's a terrible thing," remarked the
youngest.
</p>

<p>
"You can't turn back now!" said the other
angrily.
</p>

<p>
Sasha waited until he could no longer hear their
footsteps.  Then he started up, and, keeping
away from the road they had taken, ran through
the woods and thickets in the direction of the
town.  His only thought was, to reach the hill
the robbers had mentioned, from which both
roads could be seen.  He knew it well; there was
a bridle-path, shorter than the main highway,
and the baron would probably take it, as he was
on horseback.  The hill divided the two roads;
it was covered with young birch-trees, which
grew very thickly on the summit and almost
choked up the path.  But there was a long spur
of thicket, he remembered, running out on the
ridge, and whoever stood at the end of it could
almost look into the town.
</p>

<p>
Sasha was so excited that he took a track
almost as short as a bird flies.  He tore through
bushes and brambles without thinking of the
scratches they gave him; he leaped across gullies,
and ran at full speed over open fields; he was
faint, and bruised, and breathless, but he never
paused until the farthest point of the thicket on
the hill was reached.  It was then about an hour
before sunset, and only one or two travellers on
foot were to be seen upon the highway.  The
town was half a mile off, but he could plainly see
where the bridle-track issued from a little lane
between the houses.  Carefully concealing himself
under a thick alder-bush, he kept his eyes fixed
upon that point.
</p>

<p>
He was obliged to wait for what seemed a
long, long time.  The sun was just setting when,
finally, a horseman made his appearance, and
Sasha knew by the large white horse that it must
be the baron.  The rider looked at his watch,
and then began to canter along the level towards
the hill.  There was no time to lose; so, without
pausing a moment to think, Sasha sprang from
his hiding-place, and darted down the grassy
slope at full speed, crying:
</p>

<p>
"Lord Baron!  Lord Baron!"
</p>

<p>
The rider, at first, did not seem to heed.  He
cantered on, and it required all Sasha's remaining
strength to reach the path in advance of him.
Then he dropped upon his knees, lifted up his
hands, and cried once more:
</p>

<p>
"Stop, Lord Baron!"
</p>

<p>
The baron reined up his horse just in time to
avoid trampling on the boy.  Sasha sprang to
his feet, seized the bridle, and gasped, "The
robbers! the robbers!"
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?&mdash;and what does this mean?"
asked the baron in a stern voice.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p32"></a>
But Sasha was too much in earnest to feel
afraid of the great lord.  "I am Sasha, the son
of Ivan, the son of Gregor," he replied; and then
related as rapidly as he could all that he had
seen and heard.
</p>

<p>
The baron looked at his pistols.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" he cried, "the caps have been taken off!
You may have done me good service, boy.  Wait
here: it is not enough to escape the rascals; we
must capture them!"
</p>

<p>
He turned his horse, and galloped back at full
speed towards the town.  Sasha watched him,
thinking only that he was saved at last.  It was
growing dark when the boy's quick ear caught
the sound of footsteps in the opposite direction.
He turned and saw the three men approaching
rapidly.  With a deadly sense of terror he
started and ran towards the town.
</p>

<p>
"Kill the little spy!" shouted behind him a
voice which he well knew.
</p>

<p>
Sasha cried aloud for help as he ran, but no
help came.  He was already weak and exhausted
from the exertion he had made, and he heard the
robbers coming nearer and nearer.  All at once
it seemed to him that his cries were answered;
but at the same moment a heavy blow came
down upon his head and shoulder.  He fell to
the ground, and knew no more.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CHAPTER IV.
</p>

<p>
When Sasha came to his senses it seemed
to him that he must have been dead for
a long time.  First of all, he had to
think who he was; and this was not so easy as
you may suppose, for he found himself lying in
bed in a room he had never seen before.  It was
broad daylight, and the sun shone upon one of
his hands, which was so white and thin that it
did not seem to belong to him.  Then he lifted
it, and was amazed to find how little strength
there was in his arm.  But he brought it to his
head at last&mdash;and there was another surprise.
All his long silken hair was gone!  He was so
weak and bewildered that he groaned aloud, and
the tears ran down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
There was a noise in the room, and presently
old Gregor, his grandfather, bent over him as he
lay in bed.
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather," said the boy&mdash;and how feeble
his voice sounded&mdash;"am I your Sasha still?"
</p>

<p>
The old man, crying for joy, dropped on his
knees and uttered a short prayer.  "Now you
will get well!" he cried; "but you mustn't talk;
the doctor said you were not to talk."
</p>

<p>
"But where am I, grandfather?" asked Sasha.
</p>

<p>
"In the palace!  And the baron's own doctor
comes every day to see you; and they allow me
to stay here and nurse you&mdash;it will be a week
to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter&mdash;what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk, for the love of heaven!" said
Gregor; "you saved the baron from being robbed
and killed; and the principal robber struck your
head and broke your arm; and the baron and
the people came just at the right time; and one
of them was shot, and the other two are in
prison.  O, my boy, remember the altar of the
black god Perun; be obedient to me; shut your
eyes and keep quiet!"
</p>

<p>
But Sasha could not shut his eyes.  Little by
little his memory came back, and a sense of what
he had done filled his mind and made him happy.
He felt a dull ache in his left arm, and found
that it was so tightly bandaged he could not
move it, as he lay quite still, while his
grandfather sat and watched him with sparkling eyes.
After a time the door opened and a strange
gentleman came in; it was the doctor.  The old
man rose and conversed with him in whispers.
Then Sasha found that a spoon was held to his
lips; he mechanically swallowed something that
had a strange, pleasant taste, and almost
immediately fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
In a day or two he was strong enough to
sit up in bed, and was allowed to talk.  Then
the baron and the baroness came with the
lady who was their guest, to see him.  They
were all eager to learn the particulars of the
occurrence, especially how Sasha had discovered
the plot of the robbers.  He began at the
beginning, and had got as far as the latter's
change of language on seeing him, when he
stopped in great confusion, and looked at his
grandfather.
</p>

<p>
Gregor neither spoke nor moved, but his eyes
seemed to say plainly, "Tell everything."
</p>

<p>
Sasha then related the whole story to the
end.  The baroness came to the bedside, stooped
down, kissed him, and said, "You have saved
your lord!"
</p>

<p>
But the other lady, who had been watching
him very closely and curiously, suddenly
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's the same nice-looking young serf
that I saw before; and when I spoke of him
in French he blushed.  I was sure he understood
me!  Don't you understand me now, my boy?"
</p>

<p>
She asked the question in French, and Sasha
answered in the same language, "Yes, madam."
</p>

<p>
The lady clapped her hands with delight; but
the baron asked very sternly:
</p>

<p>
"Where did you learn so many languages?"
</p>

<p>
"From me!" answered Gregor, instantly.  "The
boy likes to know things, and I've always
thought&mdash;saving your opinion, my lord&mdash;that
when God gives anyone a strong wish for knowledge
he means it to be answered.  So I opened
to him all there is in this foolish old head of
mine while we were together in the forest; and
it was such a pleasure for him to take that it
came to be a pleasure for me to give.  You
understand, my lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the baroness, "I understand that
without Sasha's knowledge of German my
husband would probably have been murdered."
</p>

<p>
"That's not so certain," replied the baron.
"But some celebrated man has said, 'All's well
that ends well.'  The boy did his duty like a
full-grown man, and I'll take care of him."
</p>

<p>
Therewith they went out of the room, and
Sasha immediately asked in some anxiety,
"Grandfather, you meant that I should tell?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my boy," said Gregor readily, "for the
youngest robber has already confessed that they
spoke in German, and thought themselves safe
while you were passing.  They are vagabonds
from the borders of Poland, and knew a little of
three or four tongues.  It is all right, Sasha; the
baron is satisfied, and means to help you.  Your
chance has come sooner than I expected.  I must
have a little time to think about it; my head is
like a stiff joint, hard to bend when I want to
use it.  It's a piece of good luck to me that you
can't get out of bed for a week to come!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed as he left the bedside and took
his seat on the broad stone bench beside the
fireplace.  Sasha kept silent, for he knew that the
old man's brain was hard at work.  He tried to
do a little thinking himself, but it made him feel
weak and giddy; in fact, the blow upon his
head would have killed a more delicate boy.
</p>

<p>
His strength came back so rapidly, however,
that in a week he was able to walk about with
his arm in a sling.  He was still pale, and looked
so strange in his short hair that on his first visit
home his mother burst into tears on seeing him.
Then Minka, Peter, Sergius, and Waska lifted up
their voices and cried; and Ivan, who was at first
angry with them, finally cried also, without
knowing why he did it.  All this made Sasha
feel very uncomfortable, and he was on the point
of saying, "I won't do it again!" when Old
Gregor made silence in the house.  He had
looked through the window and seen some of the
neighbours coming; so the whole family became
cheerful again as rapidly as they could.
</p>

<p>
By this time Gregor had made up his mind.
Sasha knew that he could not change it if he
would, and he was therefore very glad to find
how well his grandfather's notions agreed with
his own.  While he was waiting for the baron
to speak again he was not losing time; for the
strange lady who was visiting at the castle took
quite a friendly interest in teaching him French
and German, and giving him Russian books
which were not too difficult to read.  He was so
eager to satisfy her that he really made
astonishing progress.
</p>

<p>
When the robbers were tried before the judge
he was called upon to give testimony against
them.  One of the three having been killed, the
youngest one was not afraid to confess, and his
story and Sasha's agreed perfectly.  The boy
described the unwillingness of the former to
undertake the crime; even the baron said a word
in his favour, and the judge at last sentenced
him to be banished to Siberia for only ten years,
while the older robber was sent there for life.
</p>

<p>
That evening the baron asked Sasha, "Would
you like to be one of my house-servants, boy?"
</p>

<p>
Just as his grandfather had advised him, Sasha
answered, "It is not for me to choose, my lord;
but I think I can serve you much more to your
profit if you will let me try to become a merchant."
</p>

<p>
"A merchant!" exclaimed the baron.
</p>

<p>
"Not all at once," said Sasha.  "I could be of
use now as a boy to help carry and sell things,
because I can count, and speak a little in other
tongues.  I could make myself so useful to some
merchant that he would give me a chance to
learn the whole business in time.  Then I should
earn much money, and could pay you for the
privilege."
</p>

<p>
The baron had often envied noblemen of his
acquaintance, some of whose serfs were rich
manufacturers or merchants, and paid them large
annual sums for the privilege of living for
themselves.  Here seemed to be a chance for him
to gain something in the same way.  The boy
spoke so confidently, and looked in his face
with such straightforward eyes, that he felt
obliged to consider the proposition seriously.
</p>

<p>
"How will you get to St. Petersburg?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"When you go, my lord," said Sasha, "I could
sit on the box at the coachman's feet.  I will
help him with the horses, and it shall cost you
nothing.  When I get there I know I shall find
a place."
</p>

<p>
The baron then said, "You may go."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
CHAPTER V.
</p>

<p>
Here, as a boy not yet fifteen, Sasha begins
his career as a man.  The task he has
undertaken demands the industry, the
patience, and the devotion of his life; but he has
been prepared for it by a sound if a somewhat
hard experience.  I hope the boys who read this
feel satisfied already that he is going to succeed;
yet I know also that they like to be certain, and
to have some little information as to how it came
about.  So I will allow fifteen years to pass, and
we will now look upon Sasha as a man of about
thirty years of age.
</p>

<p>
He has an office and warehouse on the great
main street of St. Petersburg, which is called the
<i>Nevsky Prospekt</i>, that is, the Perspective of the
Neva, because when you look down it you see
the blue waters of the river Neva at the end.
Over the door there is a large sign-board with
the name "Alexander Ivanovitch."[<a id="chap0105fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0105fn1">1</a>]  He employs
a number of clerks and salesmen, and has a
servant who would go through fire and water to
help or serve him.  I must relate how he found
this man, and why the latter is so faithful.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0105fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0105fn1text">1</a>] <i>Ivanovitch</i> means "the son of Ivan."  Russian family names
are formed in this manner, and therefore the son has a different
name from the father, unless their baptismal names are the
same.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On one of his journeys of business, five years
before, Sasha visited the town of Perm, on the
western side of the Ural Mountains.  It is on
the main highway to Siberia, and criminals are
continually passing either on the way thither
in chains, or returning in rags when their time of
banishment has expired.  One evening Sasha
found by the roadside, in the outskirts of the
town, a miserable looking wretch who seemed to
be at the point of death.  He felt the man's
pulse, lifted up his head and looked in his face,
and was startled at recognizing the younger of
the three robbers who had attacked Baron Popoff.
He had him taken to the inn, tended, and restored,
and after being convinced of his earnest
desire to lead a better life gave him employment.
The robber was not naturally a bad man, but
very ignorant and superstitious.  It seemed to
him both a miracle and a warning that he should
have been saved by Sasha, and he fully believed
that his soul would be lost if he should ever act
dishonestly towards him.
</p>

<p>
Keeping his heart steadily upon the great
purpose of his life, Sasha rose from one step to
another until he became an independent and
wealthy merchant, far wealthier, indeed, than
the baron supposed.  He paid the latter a
handsome sum for his time, and sent only small
presents of money to his parents, for he knew
how few and simple their wants were.  He felt
a thousand times more keenly than old Gregor
what it was to be a serf.  The old man was still
living, but very feeble and helpless, and Sasha
often grew wild at the thought that he might die
before knowing freedom.
</p>

<p>
His plan of action had been long fixed, and now
the hour had come when he determined to try it.
He had for years kept a strict watch over the
baron's life in St. Petersburg, knew the amount
of his increasing debts and the embarrassment
they occasioned him, and could very nearly
calculate the hour when ruin would overtake him.
He was not disappointed, therefore, one morning
at receiving an urgent summons to wait upon his
master.
</p>

<p>
"Sasha," said the latter, laying his hand upon
the shoulder of his serf with a familiarity he had
never displayed before, "you are an honest,
faithful fellow.  I need a few thousand roubles
for a month or two; can you get the money for me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard, my lord," answered Sasha, "that
you are in difficulty.  I knew why you sent for
me, and I come to offer you a way out of all your
troubles.  Your debts amount to more than a
hundred thousand roubles: would you like to be
relieved of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Would I not!&mdash;but how?" exclaimed the baron.
</p>

<p>
"I will pay them, my lord; but you will do
one thing for me in return."
</p>

<p>
"You, you!"
</p>

<p>
"I," Sasha quietly answered, "I will free you,
and you will free me!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" the baron cried, springing to his feet.
His pride was touched.  He was fond of boasting
that he also had a serf who was a rich merchant,
and the fact had many a time helped his credit
when he wanted to borrow money.  Unconsciously
he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"You have not the money," he said.
</p>

<p>
Sasha, who understood what was passing
through the mind of the baron, suffered so much
from his cruel uncertainty that he turned deadly
pale.
</p>

<p>
"I am well known," he answered, "and can
procure the money in an hour.  How much is
my serfdom worth to you?  My annual payment
is hardly one-tenth of the usurious interest which
your debt wrings from you: I offer to release
you from all trouble, and thus add not less than
eight thousand roubles a year to your income.
And my freedom, which you can now sell back
to me at such a price, may be mine without
buying in a few years more!"
</p>

<p>
The emperor, Alexander II. (who was assassinated
in 1881), had at that time just succeeded to
the throne, and his intention to emancipate the
serfs was already suspected by the people.  Sasha
knew that he was running a great risk in what
he said; but his clasped hands, his trembling
voice, his eyes filled with tears, affected the
baron more powerfully than his words.
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence.  The master turned
away to the window, and weighed the offer
rapidly in his mind; the serf waited in breathless
anxiety in the centre of the room.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the baron turned and struck his
clenched fist on the table.  Then he stretched
out his hand and said:
</p>

<p>
"Alexander Ivanovitch, I am glad to make
your acquaintance as a friend; I am no longer
your master."
</p>

<p>
Sasha took the hand of the baron and kissed
it, and his tears fell thick and fast.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Lord Baron," he cried, "give me also
the freedom of my father and grandfather, and
I will add a payment of five thousand roubles
a year for ten years to come!"
</p>

<p>
"And your ancestors for five hundred years
back," the baron answered laughing.  "I don't
know their names, but they can all be thrown
into the deed in one lump."
</p>

<p>
Before another day passed it was done.
Sasha and the other living members of his family
were free, and his ancestors also would have
been free if they had not been dead.  With the
parchment signed and sealed in his pocket he
took a carriage and post-horses and travelled day
and night until he reached his native village.
No one knew the stranger in his rich merchant's
dress; his father and brothers were at work, and
his mother had gone to see a neighbour:&mdash;old
Gregor was alone in the house.  He was leaning
back in a rude arm-chair, with a sheep-skin over
his knees; his eyes were closed, his mouth slightly
open, and his face so haggard and sunken that
Sasha immediately thought he was dead.
</p>

<p>
He knelt down beside the chair, and placed
his hand on the old man's heart, to see if it still
beat.  Presently came a broken voice, saying:
</p>

<p>
"The black god&mdash;the truth, my boy!" and
Gregor feebly stretched a hand towards Sasha's
breast.  The latter tore open his dress, and
spread the cold, horny fingers over his own heart,
the warmth of which seemed to kindle a fresh
life in the old man.  He at last opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Little Sasha!" said he; "little Sasha will keep
his word."
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather," exclaimed Sasha, "I have kept it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a man&mdash;a brave looking man," said
Gregor; "but he has the voice of my boy Sasha;
and he has, yes, I know he has, his hand upon
my heart."
</p>

<p>
Sasha could no longer restrain himself.
</p>

<p>
"And the boy is a freeman, grandfather," he
exclaimed; "we are all free: here is the baron's
deed, which says so, with the seal of the empire
upon it.  Look, grandfather, look!&mdash;do you
understand, you are free!"
</p>

<p>
Gregor was lifted to his feet as if by an
unseen hand.  At that moment Sasha's father
and mother, and brothers entered the house.  The
old man did not heed their cries of astonishment;
clasping the parchment to his breast, he looked
upward and exclaimed in a piercing voice:
</p>

<p>
"Free at last! all free!  I will carry the news
to God!"
</p>

<p>
Then, before any one&mdash;not even Sasha&mdash;could
step forward to assist him, he reeled and fell on
the floor&mdash;dead.  His prayer had been granted.

<h3>
THE COOLEST MAN IN RUSSIA.
</h3>

<p>
I've seen many a brave man in my time, sure
enough," said old Ivan Starikoff, removing
his short pipe to puff out a volume of
smoke from beneath his long white moustache.
</p>

<p>
"Many and many a one have I seen; for, thank
heaven, the children of holy Russia are never
wanting in that way, but all of them put together
wouldn't make one such man as our old colonel,
Count Pavel Petrovitch Severin.  It was not
only that he faced danger like a man&mdash;all the
others did that&mdash;but he never seemed to know
that there was any danger at all.  It was as
good as a reinforcement of ten battalions to have
him among us in the thick of a fight, and to see
his grand, tall figure drawn up to its full height,
and his firm face and keen gray eyes turned
straight upon the smoke of the enemy's line, as
if defying them to hurt him.  And when the
very earth was shaking with the cannonade, and
balls were flying thick as hail, and the hot,
stifling smoke closed us in like the shadow of
death, with a flash and a roar breaking through
it every now and then, and the whole air filled
with the rush of the shot, like the wind sweeping
through a forest in autumn,&mdash;then Petrovitch
would light a cigarette and hum a snatch of a
song, as coolly as if he were at a dinner party in
Moscow.  And it really seemed as if the bullets ran
away from <i>him</i>, instead of his running away from
them; for he never got shot.  But if he saw any
of us beginning to waver he would call out cheerily:
</p>

<p>
"Never fear, lads, remember what the old song
says!" for in those days we had an old camp-song
that we were fond of singing, and the chorus of
it was this:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then fear not swords that brightly shine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor towers that grimly frown;<br />
  For God shall march before our line,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hew our foemen down."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"He said this so often, that at last he got the
nickname among us of "Don't Fear," and he
deserved it, if ever man did.  Why, Father
Nickolai Pavlovitch himself (the Emperor Nicholas)
gave him the cross of St. George[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] with his
own hand at the siege of Varna, in the year
'28.  You see, our battery had been terribly cut
up by the Turkish fire, so at last there was only
about half a dozen of us left on our feet.  It
was as hot work as I was ever in,&mdash;shot pelting,
earthworks crumbling, gabions crashing, guns
and gun-carriages tumbling over one another,
men falling on every side like leaves, till all at
once a shot went slap through our flag-staff, and
down came the colours!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap02fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap02fn1text">1</a>] The highest Russian decoration.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Quick as lightning Pavel Petrovitch was
upon the parapet, caught the flag as it fell, and
<i>held</i> it right in the face of all the Turkish guns,
while I and another man spliced the pole with
our belts.  You may think how the unbelievers
let fly at him when they saw him standing there
on the top of the breast-work, just as if he'd
been set up for a mark; and all at once I saw
one fellow (an Albanian by his dress, and you
know what deadly shots <i>they</i> are) creep along to
the very angle of the wall and take steady aim
at him!
</p>

<p>
"I made a spring to drag the colonel down (I
was his servant, you know, and whoever hurt
him hurt <i>me</i>); but before I could reach him I
saw the flash of the Albanian's piece, and Pavel
Petrovitch's cap went spinning into the air with
a hole right through it just above the forehead.
And what do you think the colonel did?  Why,
he just snapped his fingers at the fellow, and
called out to him, in some jibber-jabber tongue
only fit to talk to a Turk in:
</p>

<p>
"'Can't you aim better than that, you fool?
If <i>I</i> were your officer I'd give you thirty lashes
for wasting the government ammunition!'
</p>

<p>
"Well, as I said before, he got the St. George,
and of course everybody congratulated him, and
there was a great shaking of hands, and giving
of good wishes, and drinking his health in <i>mavro
tchai</i>&mdash;that's a horrid mess of eggs, and scraped
cheese, and sour milk, and Moldavian wine,
which these Danube fellows have the impudence
to call 'black tea,' as if it was anything like the
good old tea we Russians drink at home!  (I've
always thought, for my part, that tea ought to
grow in Russia; for it's a shame that these Chinese
idolators should have such grand stuff all to
themselves.)
</p>

<p>
"Well, just in the height of the talk Pavel
Petrovitch takes the cross off his neck, and holds
it out in his hand&mdash;just so&mdash;and says:
</p>

<p>
"'Well, gentlemen, you say I'm the coolest man
in the regiment, but perhaps everybody wouldn't
agree with you.  Now, just to show that I
want nothing but fair play, if I ever meet my
match in that way I'll give him this cross of
mine!'
</p>

<p>
"Now among the officers who stood near him
was a young fellow who had lately joined&mdash;a
quiet, modest lad, quite a boy to look at, with
light curly hair and a face as smooth as any
lady's.  But when he heard what the colonel
said he looked up suddenly, and there came
a flash from his clear blue eyes like the sun
striking a bayonet.  And then I thought to
myself:
</p>

<p>
"'It won't be an easy thing to match Pavel
Petrovitch; but if it <i>can</i> be done, here is the man
to do it!'
</p>

<p>
"I think that campaign was the hardest I
ever served in.  Before I was enlisted I had
often heard it said that the Turks had no winter;
but I had always thought that this was only
a 'yarn,' though, indeed, it would be only a just
judgment upon the unbelievers to lose the
finest part of the whole year.  But when down
there I found it true, sure enough.  Instead of a
good, honest, cracking frost to freshen everything
up, as our proverb says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Na zimni Kholod<br />
  Vsiaki molod'&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
(in winter's cold every one is young), it was
all chill, sneaking rain, wetting us through and
through, and making the hill-sides so slippery
that we could hardly climb them, and turning
all the low grounds into a regular lake of mud,
through which it was a terrible job to drag our
cannon.  Many a time in after days, when I've
heard spruce young cadets at home, who had
never smelt powder in their lives, talking big
about 'glorious war,' and all that, I've said to
myself, 'Aha, my fine fellows! if you had been
where <i>I</i> have been, marching for days and nights
over ankles in mud, with nothing to eat but stale
black bread, so hard that you had to soak
it before you could get it down; and if you'd
had to drink water through which hundreds of
horses had just been trampling; and to scramble
up and down hills under a roasting sun, with
your feet so swollen and sore that every step
was like a knife going into you; and to lie all
night in the rain, longing for the sun to rise that
you might dry yourself a bit&mdash;perhaps <i>then</i> you
wouldn't talk quite so loud about 'glorious war'!"
</p>

<p>
"However, we drove the Turks across the
Balkans at last, and got down to Yamboli, a
little town at the foot of the mountains which
commands the high-road to Adrianople.  And
there the unbelievers made a stand, and fought
right well.  I will say that of them; for they
knew that if Adrianople was lost all was over.
But God fought for us, and we beat them;
though indeed, with half our men sick, and our
clothes all in rags, and our arms rusted, and our
powder mixed with sand by those rogues of
army-contractors, it was a wonder that we could
fight at all.
</p>

<p>
"Towards afternoon, just as the enemy were
beginning to give way, I saw Pavel Petrovitch
(who was a general by this time) looking very
hard at a mortar-battery about a hundred yards
to our right; and all at once he struck his knee
forcibly with his hand, and shouted:
</p>

<p>
"'What do the fellows mean by firing like
that?  They might as well pelt the Turks with
potatoes!  I'll soon settle them!  Here,
Ivan!'  Away he went, and I after him; and he burst
into the battery like a storm, and roared out:
</p>

<p>
"'Where's the blockhead who commands this
battery?'
</p>

<p>
"A young officer stepped forward and saluted;
and who should this be but the light-haired
youth with the blue eyes whom I had noticed
that night at Varna.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, you won't command it to-morrow, my
fine fellow, for I'll have you turned out this very
day.  Do you know that not a single shell that
you have thrown away since I've been watching
you has exploded at all?'
</p>

<p>
"'With your excellency's leave,' said the young
fellow, respectfully, but pretty firmly too, 'the
fault is none of mine.  These fuses are ill-made,
and will not burn down to the powder.'
</p>

<p>
"'Fuses!' exclaimed the general.  'Don't talk
to me of fuses; I'm too old for that rubbish!
Isn't it enough for you to bungle your work, but
you must tell me a falsehood into the bargain?'
</p>

<p>
"At the word 'falsehood' the young officer's
face seemed to turn red-hot all in a moment, and
I saw his hand clench as if he would drive his
fingers through the flesh.  He made one stride
to the heap of bomb-shells, and taking one up in
his arms struck a match on it.
</p>

<p>
"'Now,' said he quietly, 'your excellency can
judge for yourself.  I'm going to light this fuse;
if your excellency will please to stand by and
watch it burn you will see whether I have told
you a falsehood or not.'
</p>

<p>
"The general started, as well he might.  Not
that he was afraid&mdash;you may be pretty sure of
<i>that</i>&mdash;but to hear this quiet, bashful lad, who
looked as if he had nothing in him, coolly propose
to hold a lighted shell in his arms to see if it
would go off, and ask <i>him</i> to stand by and watch
it, was enough to startle anybody.  However, he
wasn't one to think twice about accepting a
challenge; so he folded his arms and stood there like
a statue.  The young officer lighted the fuse, and
it began to burn.
</p>

<p>
"As for me and the other men, you may fancy
what <i>we</i> felt like.  Of course we couldn't run
while our officers were standing their ground;
but we knew that if the shell <i>did</i> go off, it
would blow every man of us to bits, and it was
not pleasant to have to stand still and wait for
it.  I saw the men set their teeth hard as the
flame caught the fuse; and as for me, I wished
with all my heart and soul that if there were any
good fuses in the heap this might turn out to be
one of the bad ones.  But no, it burned away
merrily enough, and came down, and down, and
down nearer and nearer to the powder.  The
young officer never moved a muscle, but stood
looking steadily at the general, and the general
at him.  At last the red spark got close to the
metal of the shell, and then I shut my eyes and
prayed God to receive my soul.
</p>

<p>
"Just at that moment I heard the man next
me give a quick gasp, as if he had just come up
from a plunge under water; and I opened my
eyes again just in time to see the fuse go <i>out</i>, and
the young officer letting the shell drop at the
general's feet without a word.
</p>

<p>
"For a moment the general stood stock-still,
looking as if he didn't quite know whether to
knock the young fellow down or to hug him in
his arms like a son; but at last he held out his
hand to him and said:
</p>

<p>
"'Well, it's a true proverb, that every one
meets his match some day, and I've met mine today,
there's no denying it.  There's the Cross of
St. George for you, my boy, and right well you
deserve it, for if I'm 'the coolest man in my
regiment,' you're the coolest in all Russia!'
</p>

<p>
"And so said all the rest when the story got
abroad; and the commander-in-chief himself, the
great Count Diebitsch, sent for the lad, and said
a few kind words to him that made his face
flush up like a young girl's.  But in after days
he became one of the best officers the Russian
army ever had; and I've seen him with my own
eyes complimented by the emperor himself in
presence of the whole army.  And from that
day forth the whole lot of us, officers and men
alike, never spoke of him by any other name but
<i>Khladnokrovni</i>&mdash;'the cold-blooded one.'"

<h3>
KATINKA, THE PEASANT MAID.
</h3>

<p>
Katinka was tired, and lonely too.  All
day long, and for many days together, she
had plied her distaff busily, drawing out
the thread finer and finer from the great bunches
of flax, which she herself had gathered and dried,
till the birch-bark basket at her feet was almost
filled with firm, well-shaped "twists," and the
sticks in the great earthen pipkin, upon which
the thread must be wound, grew fewer and fewer.
</p>

<p>
The tips of her fingers were sore, and it was
dull work with no one to speak to except her
faithful cat, Dimitri, who was never content
when he saw his mistress working, unless he had
a ball of thread for himself; and as she looked
about her cheerless little room, so lonely now, she
thought of the days when a kind mother had
been near to lighten every duty; and joyous,
merry children had been her companions in all
childish sports.  She hated the tiresome flax
now, but <i>then</i> the happiest days were spent in
the great flax-fields, playing at "hide-and-seek"
up and down the paths the reapers made.  And
when the summer showers came pelting down,
how she would catch her little sister Lisa, and
run home with her on her back, while neighbour
Voscovitch's children laughed and shouted after
her as she ran.  Ah, those were happy days!
But now mother and sister were gone!  Only
she and her father were left in the little home,
and she had to work so hard!  She did wish
that her life was different; that she was not poor
lonely Katinka the peasant maid any more.  Oh! why
could she not be like the rich Lady Feodorovna
instead, whose father, Count Vassilivitch,
owned nearly all the houses and lands from Tver
to Torjok, and had more than three hundred serfs
on his estate.
</p>

<p>
Now Katinka's father, Ivan Rassaloff, was
only an <i>istvostchick</i> (a drosky or cab driver), and
owned nothing but a rickety old drosky,[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>] and
Todcloff, a sturdy little Cossack pony, and drove
travellers here and there for a few kopecks a
trip.  But he saved money, and Katinka helped
him to earn more; and one of these days, when
they could sell the beautiful lace flounce on
which she had been working during all her odd
moments for three years, and which was nearly
finished, they would be rich indeed.  Besides, the
isba (cottage) was not really so bad, and it was
all their own; and then there was always Dimitri
to talk to, who surely seemed to understand
everything she said.  So a smile chased away the
gathering frown, and this time she looked round
the room quite contentedly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] Or droitzschka, a four-wheeled pleasure carriage.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Shall I tell you what the isba was like, that
you may know how the poor people live in
Russia?  It was built of <i>balks</i> (great beams or
rafters), laid horizontally one above the other,
the ends crossing at each corner of the building;
and it had a pointed roof, somewhat like that of
a Swiss <i>châlet</i>.  Inside the chinks were filled
with moss and lime, to keep out the cold.  It
contained only one room; but a great canvas
curtain hung from the roof, which by night
divided the room in two, but by day was drawn
aside.
</p>

<p>
There was a deal table, holding some earthenware
pipkins, jars, and a <i>samorar</i>, or tea-urn&mdash;for
even the poorest peasants have an urn, and drink
tea at least three times a day; a deal settee, on
which lay the winter store of flax; Katinka's
distaff, and the curious candlestick which the
Russian peasants use.  This is a tall wooden
upright fastened into a sort of trough, or
hollowed log of birchwood, to keep it erect.  To
the top an iron cross-bar is attached (which
can be raised or lowered at will), having at the
end a small bowl containing oil and a floating
wick, which burns brightly for several hours,
and is easily lowered and refilled; while the
wooden trough below catches the oil which
drops.
</p>

<p>
But the most curious thing in the room was
the stove.  It was made of sheet-iron, and very
large, with a door at one end, into which whole
logs of wood could be put at once.  It was oblong,
and flat on the top, like a great black trunk; and
on this flat top, with the fire smouldering away
beneath him, Ivan always slept at night in
the winter; and sometimes, when it was very
cold, Katinka would bring her sheep-skin blanket
and sleep there too!  Not one Russian isba in
fifty contains a bed; when there is a large family,
father, mother, and little children all crowd upon
the top of the stove in winter, and in summer
they roll themselves up in their blankets and
sleep outside by the door!
</p>

<p>
The lamp was lighted and shone brightly on
Katinka, who made quite a pretty picture as she
rested a while from her work to speak to Dimitri.
She wore a white chemise with very full, long
sleeves, and over it a <i>sarafane</i> of red linen with
a short boddice and shoulder-straps of dark blue.
On her head she had tied a gay-coloured kerchief,
to keep the dust of the flax from her glossy black
hair, which hung in a single heavy braid far
down her back.  One of these days, if she should
marry, she would have to divide it in two braids,
and wear a kerchief always.
</p>

<p>
Her shoes were braided, in a kind of basket-work,
of strips of birch-bark, very pliant and
comfortable, though rather clumsy in appearance.
</p>

<p>
All the day Katinka had been thinking of
something which her father had told her in the
morning about their neighbour, Nicholas Paloffsky,
and his poor, motherless little ones.  The
mother had been very ill, for a long, long time,
and Nicholas had spent all he could earn in
buying medicines and good food for her, but
they could not save her life.  Then, when she
died Nicholas was both father and mother to the
little ones for months; but at last he too fell ill,
and now there was no one to assist him.
</p>

<p>
Besides, he did not own his isba, and if the
rent were not paid the very next day the <i>starosta</i>,
or landlord, would turn him and his little
ones out-of-doors, bitter winter though it was!
</p>

<p>
That was fearful!  What could she do to help
him?  Suddenly there flashed across her mind a
thought of her beautiful lace flounce, on which
she had worked till she loved every thread of it,
and in whose meshes she had woven many a
bright fancy about the spending of the silver
roubles that would be hers when she sold it.
She had intended to buy a scarlet <i>cusackau</i>, or
jacket, with gold embroidery, and a new drosky
for her father, so that his passengers might give
him a few more kopecks for a ride.  But other
plans came to her mind now.
</p>

<p>
Just then Ivan came home hungry; and as
she hastened to prepare his supper of tea and
black bread and raw carrots, and a kind of
mushroom stewed in oil, she almost forgot of her
neighbour Nicholas while waiting on her father,
who was always so glad to come home to her
and his snug, warm room.
</p>

<p>
But to-night, for a wonder, he was cross.  All
day he had waited in the cold, bleak public-square
of Torjok, beating his arms and feet to
keep himself warm; and occasionally, I fear,
beating his patient little pony for the same
reason.  Not a "fare" had come near him, except
a fat priest, in a purple silk gown and
broad-brimmed hat, with long, flowing hair and beard,
a gold-mounted staff in his hand, and a silver
crucifix hanging from his girdle, who on reaching
the church to which he bade Ivan drive quickly,
gave him his blessing&mdash;and nothing more!  So
Ivan's pockets were empty, and the pony must
go without his supper, unless Katinka had some
dried fish for him.
</p>

<p>
Katinka, who had a tender heart for all
animals, carried a great bowlful of fish out to
Todeloff, who nibbled it eagerly; for ponies in
Russia, especially those that are brought from
Iceland, consider dried fish a great delicacy, and
in winter often live on it for weeks together.  Then
she gave him a "good-night" kiss on the little
white spot on his nose, and he seemed to whisper,
"Now I don't mind the beatings I had to-day!"
</p>

<p>
When she returned to the house her father
was already wrapped up in a sheepskin blanket
on top of the stove, and snoring lustily; so she
lowered the curtain and crept softly into her
little corner behind it.  But she could not sleep,
for her mind was disturbed by thoughts of
neighbour Nicholas, whose little ones perhaps
were hungry; and at last she arose, filled and
lighted the tall lamp, then unrolled her precious
flounce, and worked steadily at it till, when
morning came, only one little sprig remained to
be done, and her doubts as to what she should
do were dispelled in the bright sunlight.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast, which she made ready as
briskly as though she had slept soundly all
night, she said:
</p>

<p>
"Father, let me be your first fare to-day, and
perhaps I may bring you good luck.  Will you
drive me to the Lady Feodorovna's?"
</p>

<p>
"What in the world are you going to do there,
Katinka?" said her father, wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"To ask if she will buy my lace," said Katinka.
"She has so many beautiful lace dresses, surely
she will find a place on one for my flounce."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said Ivan; "then we will have a feast.
You shall make a cake of white flour and honey,
and we will not eat "black-brod" for a month!
But what will we do with so much money, my
child?"
</p>

<p>
Katinka hesitated for a moment; then said,
shyly:
</p>

<p>
"Pay Nicholas Paloffsky's rent, and send the
Torjok doctor to cure him.  May I, father?" she
added, entreatingly, forgetting that the money
would be her own.
</p>

<p>
"Hum-m-m!" said Ivan; "we shall see.  But
go now and prepare for your drive, for Todeloff
does not like to be kept waiting."
</p>

<p>
Katinka was soon ready.  With her sheepskin
jacket, hat and boots, she did not fear the cold;
and mounting the drosky, they drove rapidly
towards Count Vassilivitch's beautiful home, not
fearing to leave their little isba unattended, for
the neighbours were all honest, and besides, there
was nothing to steal!  A drive of four versts
(about three miles) brought them to their
journey's end, and Katinka's heart beat anxiously
as the old drosky rattled up through the courtyard
to the grand hall door; but she went bravely
up to the fine porter, and asked to see Lady
Feodorovna.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bosja moia!</i>" (bless me); "what do <i>you</i> want
with my lady?" asked the gorgeous Russ who, in
crimson and gold livery, serf though he was,
looked scornfully down on free Katinka in her
poor little sheepskin jacket.
</p>

<p>
I think Katinka would scarcely have found
courage to answer him; but luckily the lady
crossed the hall just then, and seeing Katinka,
kindly beckoned her to enter, leading the way
to her own private apartment.
</p>

<p>
"What do you wish with me?" she asked
kindly.  But Katinka was too bewildered by the
splendour on every side to answer as she should.
</p>

<p>
Truly it appeared like fairyland to the young
peasant maid.  The room was long and very
lofty; the ceiling, one great beautiful picture;
the floor had no carpet, but was inlaid with
different kinds of wood in many curious patterns;
the walls were covered with blue flowered silk,
on which mirrors and lovely pictures were hung
alternately; while beautiful statues and luxurious
couches covered with blue damask added to
the elegance and comfort of the room.
</p>

<p>
There was no big, clumsy stove to be
seen&mdash;for in the houses of the rich, in a recess in each
room, is a kind of oven, in which a great wood
fire is allowed to smoulder all day&mdash;but a delicious
feeling of warmth prevailed, and a soft, sweet
perfume floated on the air.
</p>

<p>
At last Katinka's eyes rested on the fair lady
in her soft, fleecy gown of white (for even in
winter Russian ladies wear the thinnest summer
dresses in the house), and she said softly:
</p>

<p>
"I think this heaven, and surely you are like
an angel!"
</p>

<p>
"Not an angel," said Lady Feodorovna, smiling,
"but perhaps a good fairy.  Have you a wish,
pretty maid?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, yes," replied Katinka.  "I wish, wish,
wish (for you must always make a wish to a
fairy three times) you would buy my lace flounce.
See!"&mdash;and she unrolled it hurriedly from out
the clean linen cloth in which it was wrapped.
"It is fair and white, though I have worked on
it for three years, and it is all finished but one
little sprig.  I could not wait for that; I want the
money so much.  Will you buy it?"
</p>

<p>
"What is the price?" asked the lady, who
saw that it was indeed a beautiful piece of work.
</p>

<p>
"Ninety roubles" (about fifteen pounds), said
Katinka almost in a whisper, as if she feared to
name so great a sum aloud, though she knew the
lace was worth it.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what will you do with so many
roubles?" asked the lady, not curiously, but in
such a good fairy way that Katinka said:
</p>

<p>
"Surely I need not fear to tell you.  But it is
a long story.  Will you kindly listen to it all?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, gladly; sit here," and the Lady Feodorovna
pointed to one of the beautiful blue
couches, on the extreme edge of which Katinka
sat down timidly, making a very funny picture
in her gray sheepskin jacket and scarlet gown.
"Now tell me, first, your name."
</p>

<p>
"Katinka Rassaloff, <i>barishna</i> (lady), daughter
of Ivan, peasants from beyond Torjok.  Beside
us lives a good man, Nicholas Paloffsky, who is
ill, and <i>so</i> poor.  He has four little children, and
many a day I have divided my supper with
them, and yet I fear they are often hungry.  The
baby cries all day, for there is no mother to take
care of it, and the cries trouble the poor father,
who can do nothing to help.  Besides, unless the
rent is paid to-morrow they must leave their
isba.  Think of that, lady; no home in this
bitter winter weather! no shelter for the baby!
Ah! buy my lace, that I may help them!" replied
Katinka earnestly.
</p>

<p>
Without speaking, Lady Feodorovna rose and
went to a beautiful cabinet, unlocked the door
with a tiny gold key which was suspended by a
chain to her girdle, took out a roll of silver
roubles, and laid them in Katinka's lap.
</p>

<p>
"There," said she, "are one hundred roubles.
Are you content?"
</p>

<p>
Katinka took the soft white hand in hers and
kissed it, while such a happy smile lighted up
her face that the "good fairy" needed no other
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Hasten home, Katinka," she said; "perhaps
you may see me soon again."
</p>

<p>
Katinka curtsied deeply, then almost flew out
of the great hall-door, so startling the grand
porter, who had his mouth wide open ready to
scold her, that he could not get it shut in time to
say a word, but opened his eyes instead to keep
it company, and stood looking after her till she
was seated in the drosky.  Then Ivan "flicked"
Todeloff, who kicked up his heels and rattled out
of the courtyard in fine style.  When they were
out of sight the porter found he could say "<i>bosja
moia</i>" again, so he said it; and feeling much
relieved, was gradually getting back to his usual
dignified manner, when his lady came tripping
down the stairs, wrapped in a beautiful long
sable mantle, bidding him order her sledge, and
one for her maid, to be brought to the door at
once.
</p>

<p>
When the sledges were brought Lady Feodorovna
entered hers, and drew the soft white
bear-skin robe around her, while her maid threw over
her fur hood a fine, fleecy scarf of white wool.
Then the maid put numberless packages, small
and great, into the foot of the other sledge,
leaving only just room to put herself in afterwards.
</p>

<p>
While they are waiting there I must tell you
what Lady Feodorovna's sledge was like.  It was
built something like an open brougham, except
that the back was higher, with a carved wooden
ornament on the top; there was no "dash-board,"
but the runners came far up in a curve at the
front, and where they joined was another splendid
ornament of wood, gilded and surmounted by
a gilt eagle with outspread wings.
</p>

<p>
The body of the sledge was of rose-wood, and
in the front was a beautiful painting of Cupid,
the "love-god," and his mother.  The other
sledge, which had a silver swan at the front,
was not quite so fine, although the shape was the
same.
</p>

<p>
There were no horses to draw these sledges, but
behind each stood a servant in fur jacket, cap
and boots, with a pair of skates hung over his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to go to the isba of Paloffsky, the
peasant, beyond Torjok; we will go the shorter
way, by the river," said Lady Feodorovna.
"Hasten!"
</p>

<p>
Then the servants each gave a great push, and
the sledges started off so quickly and lightly
down the slope to the river that they could
scarcely keep up with them.  When they reached
the banks of the Blankow, which flowed past the
count's grounds and was frozen over for miles,
the servants stooped and put on their skates,
binding them by long straps over their feet, and
round and round their ankles.  Then they started
down the river, and oh, how they flew! while
the sledges, with their gorgeous birds, fairly
sparkled in the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
Sooner almost than I can tell it they had
reached their journey's end; the skates were
unstrapped, and the sledges drawn up the bank to
the door of the little isba, which Lady Feodorovna
entered, followed by the maid with the parcels.
</p>

<p>
A sad picture met their eyes.  Poor Nicholas
sat on a bench by the stove, wrapped in his
sheepskin blanket, looking so pale, and thin that
he scarcely seemed alive; on his knees lay the
hungry baby, biting his little fist because he had
nothing else to bite; while on the floor beside
him sat a little three-year-old fellow crying
bitterly, whom a sad little sister was vainly
trying to comfort.
</p>

<p>
Nicholas looked up as the door opened, but did
not speak as the strange lady advanced, and bade
her maid open the packages and put their
contents on the table.  How the children stared!
The little one stopped crying, and crept up to the
table, followed shyly by his sister.  Then the
maid put a dainty white bread-roll in each little
hand.  Then she took the baby gently from off
the poor, tired father's knee, and gave it spoonful
after spoonful of sweet, pure milk, till its little
pinched cheeks seemed fairly to grow full and
rosy, and it gave a satisfied little "coo-o," that
would have done your hearts good to hear.
Meanwhile Lady Feodorovna went up to
Nicholas, and said softly:
</p>

<p>
"Look at your little ones! they are happy
now!  Can you not rouse up and drink this good
bowl of soup?  It is warm yet, and will do you
good.  Drink, and then I will tell you some good
news."
</p>

<p>
Nicholas took the bowl which she held towards
him, but his hand trembled so that it would have
fallen if she had not herself held it to his lips.
As he tasted the warm nourishing soup new life
seemed to come to him, and he grasped the bowl
eagerly, drinking till the last drop was gone; then,
looking up with a grateful smile he said simply,
"Ah! we were so hungry, my little ones and I!
Thanks, <i>barishna</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Now for my good news," said the lady.
"Here is the money for your rent; and here are
ten roubles more, for clothes for your little ones.
The food there is sufficient for to-day; to-morrow
I will send you more.  Do not thank me," she
added, as Nicholas tried to speak; "you must
thank Katinka Kassaloff for it all."
</p>

<p>
Just then a great noise was heard outside, and
little Todeloff came prancing merrily up to the
door, shaking his head and rattling the little bells
on his <i>douga</i> (the great wooden arch that all
Russian horses have attached to their collars) as
proudly as if he had the finest drosky in all
St. Petersburg behind him.
</p>

<p>
Katinka jumped quickly down, and entering
the little isba stood fairly speechless at seeing
Lady Feodorovna, whom she had left so shortly
before in her own beautiful home.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Katinka!  I have stolen a march on you,"
said the good fairy.  "There is nothing you can
do here."
</p>

<p>
"Is there not?" said Katinka.  "See! here is the
starosta's receipt for a year's rent, and there,"
turning towards the door as a venerable old man
entered, "is the Torjok doctor, who has come to
make neighbour Nicholas well."
</p>

<p>
I must tell you what the doctor was like.  He
wore a long fur coat with wide sleeves, fur boots,
and a great pair of fur gloves, so that he looked
almost like a bear standing up.  He wore queer
blue spectacles, and from under a little black
velvet cap long, silky, white hair fell over his
shoulders, and his white beard nearly reached to
his waist.
</p>

<p>
The doctor walked up to Nicholas, put his hands
on his knees, stooped, and looked gravely at him;
then rising, turned sharply to Katinka and said.
</p>

<p>
"There is no sick one here!  Why did you
bring me so far for nothing?  But it is two roubles
all the same."
</p>

<p>
"Here are the roubles," said Katinka, "and I
am very glad we do not want you;" which was
not at all polite of her.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, Ivan had driven off in search of
passengers, so the poor doctor had to walk nearly
a verst (three quarters of a mile) through the
snow, back to Torjok, which made him growl like
a real bear all the way.
</p>

<p>
Katinka went shyly up to Nicholas, who was
frowning crossly at her, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Are you angry with me?  Do not frown so, I
beg.  Well, frown if you will! the children do
not, and I did it all for them; I love them!" and
she caught up baby Demetrius and buried her
face in his curly hair to hide a tear that would
come; for she felt grieved that Nicholas did not
thank her, even with a smile, for what she had
done.
</p>

<p>
When she looked up Lady Feodorovna and
her maid were gone, and Nicholas stood before
her holding little Noviska by one hand, while
two-year-old Todleben clung to his knee.
</p>

<p>
"Katinka," said Nicholas gently, "now I can
thank you with all my heart, though I cannot
find words to speak my thanks.  Let the children
kiss you for it all; that is best."
</p>

<p>
Katinka kissed the children heartily, then she
put down the baby and opened the door, but
Nicholas's face was sober then, though his eyes
still smiled as he said:
</p>

<p>
"Come back to tea, Katinka, and bring your
father with you, and our young neighbour Alexis,
who often is hungry, and we will have a feast of
all these good things."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Horro sha</i>" (very well), said Katinka, then
she quickly ran home.
</p>

<p>
Dimitri met her at the door, crying piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Pussy!" said Katinka; "you have had
nothing to eat all day!  What a shame!"
</p>

<p>
"Miauw!" said Dimitri to that.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Pussy; you shall have all my
supper, and father's too, for we are invited out
to tea, so must not eat anything now."
</p>

<p>
"Miauw, miauw!" said pussy again to that, and
scampered away to his bowl to be all ready for
his fish, and milk, and sour cabbage soup, that he
knew was coming.
</p>

<p>
Then Katinka hastened to brush her pretty
hair, and put on her best <i>sarafane</i> (dress), with
the scarlet embroidered boddice and straps, and
was all ready when her father came in, to tell
him of their invitation, and help him to make
his toilet.
</p>

<p>
"I must have my hair cut," said Ivan, seating
himself on a bench, while Katinka tied a band
round his head, fastening it over his forehead,
then got a great pair of shears and cut his hair
straight round by the band.  Then like a good
little Russian daughter as she was, Katinka took
a little bit of tallow candle and rubbed it on her
father's head to keep it smooth, belted down his
gray flannel blouse, and handed him his sheepskin
jacket, with a hint that it was high time for
them to be off.
</p>

<p>
When the guests entered his isba Nicholas
kissed Ivan&mdash;for that is always the custom
between Russian men who are friends&mdash;then he
called to Alexis:
</p>

<p>
"Heads up, my boy, and help me with the
supper."
</p>

<p>
Alexis, who was turning somersaults in his
joy, came right side up with a spring, and soon
the feast was on the table, and the four wooden
benches drawn up around it.
</p>

<p>
Ivan and Nicholas had each a bench for
himself, Alexis sat beside Katinka, while Noviska
and Todleben were placed on the remaining
bench.
</p>

<p>
Katinka had wrapped baby Demetrius up in
his little lambskin blanket, and laid him on the
top of the stove, where he fell fast asleep while
she was patting his soft cheek.
</p>

<p>
What appetites they all had! and how quickly
the good things disappeared! wine-soup and
grouse; cheese-cakes and honey; white rolls and
sweet cream-cakes vanished almost as if by magic,
till at last there was only a bowl of cream left.
Alexis&mdash;who had acted as waiter, removing all
the empty dishes in turn&mdash;placed this in the
middle of the table, giving to each one a birch-wood
spoon and refilling the glasses with tea;
then he sat down by Katinka again at the plain
uncovered table.
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you that tea is prepared in Russia
in a very different manner to what it is in this
country.  It is made very strong, and is drunk
always from glasses instead of from cups, and so
hot that it would bring tears from the eyes of any
one but a Russian.  Milk is not used; a slice of
lemon instead floats on the top.  Sugar is never
put in the glass, but tea-drinkers hold a lump
between their teeth, and then drink the tea
through the sugar!  Even very little children
are given strong tea to drink as soon as they
have teeth to hold the sugar, and they seem to
thrive on it.
</p>

<p>
There was much to talk about.  Nicholas had
a very busy time of it in persuading Katinka to
take the rent money which the grand lady had
left, and which he protested he no longer required,
since the landlord was paid, and he already felt
well enough to work.  Katinka in her turn, had
to laugh at the jokes of Alexis, who was really a
funny boy when he was not hungry; Todleben
had to sing a droll little child's song; and Ivan
had to tell Nicholas all about the queer and
wonderful ways of his pony Todeloff.
</p>

<p>
And here we must leave the party&mdash;a happy,
grateful company, though Nicholas still looked
pale and feeble, and the "company boy," Alexis,
had eaten so tremendously that Ivan did nothing
but stare at him in astonishment.

<h3>
THE DEVIL IN THE MINE.
</h3>

<p>
For several years I was compelled to live in
the interior of Russia, the establishment
with which I was connected being one of
those centres of industrial enterprise which, for
their vastness in extent and in the number of
persons employed, are perhaps unequalled in the
whole world.
</p>

<p>
The labourers and work people&mdash;upwards of
forty thousand&mdash;under my charge, were, if anything,
slightly above the average of their compeers
in intelligence; it need not, therefore, be supposed
that this story, or rather incident, conveys any
exaggerated idea of the Russian moujik, or
common labourer.
</p>

<p>
While engaged in my office one afternoon in
September, the youth in attendance announced
that one of the miners from the works wished to
see me most particularly.  Now for a peasant to
demand an interview with his native master,
especially when the latter had just dined, was
a proceeding of very rare occurrence, and showed
that something very extraordinary must have
taken place, as the relative positions of master
and moujik in the social scale are very widely
different.
</p>

<p>
I had, however, frequently found, that by
occasionally listening to what the men had to
say, and allowing myself apparently to sympathize
with their little weaknesses, I gained the
way to their hearts; discovering at the same
time the fact that the moujik was not seldom
a much better man than his master at the period
I write of, which was before the emancipation of
the serfs in Russia.
</p>

<p>
"Allow him to come in, Ivan," I said to the
lad, and presently the miner entered.  He first
looked carefully round him, and then, equally
cautiously, he peered underneath the tables and
seats in the room&mdash;all the time nervously clutching
the greasy cap which he held in his hand.
He literally shook in his coarse bark shoes; his
face was naturally pale, but it was all the paler
by contrast with his dark eyes staring from
under their heavy eyelids.
</p>

<p>
"Barrin" (master, in a superior sense), said he,
whispering hoarsely from chattering lips, "I have
seen the devil!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said I, greatly surprised, but of
course pretending not to be alarmed in the slightest
degree; "where have you been fortunate enough
to meet with such good luck?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, barrin," answered the man eagerly, "we
have got him all right: he is safe at the bottom
of an ore-pit in our village; and," he added,
confidently, "he can't get out, because the whole
of the villagers have surrounded the pit-head."
</p>

<p>
"That is all right, Ivan," I said; "wait for
a few minutes and I will go with you, and we
will see if we can catch him."
</p>

<p>
Ordering three fast horses to be harnessed to
my tarantass, and refreshing Ivan with a good
glass of vodka (spirits) to shake his benumbed
faculties together, away we soon went at the
rate of twenty versts an hour to the village
from whence Ivan had come.
</p>

<p>
It would have been perfectly useless for me to
have attempted to persuade this man that the
person or "party," whoever he or whatever it
was they had got in the pit, was not Satan
himself.  No; the only way to convince a
Russian is to prove the matter; and even absolute
proof is not always convincing.
</p>

<p>
On my arrival at the village I at once observed
that something very unusual was exciting the
attention of the inhabitants, as instead of the
usual number of lazy men and women who are
generally to be seen standing idling about in the
streets of every hamlet, I found the place absolutely
deserted; but on an adjacent hill stood the
cause of the commotion.
</p>

<p>
A crowd of people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;were
standing round the mouth of an ore-pit,
some ten fathoms deep, and about as much like
an ordinary English draw-well without the brick-lining
as could possibly be conceived.  All were
talking at once, and all agreed that they had
caught no less a personage than the very devil
himself, as they felt quite sure that the miner
who had last come out of the pit could not
possibly be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
Now came the knotty questions: "How shall
we get his Satanic majesty out of his
retreat? and who among the spectators would be bold
enough to undertake the risk of tackling such
an awkward customer?"
</p>

<p>
The only manner of being hoisted up and
down these antiquated examples of mining is by
sitting astride a small piece of wood fastened to
the end of a not too thick piece of rope, which in
its turn is wound up and down by a wooden
windlass&mdash;not a very desirable mode of descending,
even when the men are not sure the "old
gentleman" himself is in their neighbourhood,
but decidedly dangerous when they think he is.
</p>

<p>
I therefore, although strongly solicited, declined
the honour of descending, and looked about for a
substitute.  My eye caught sight of one of those
rough-and-ready "ne'er-do-weels" who are to be
found in Russia as well as in every other
country&mdash;men who come to the surface of society when
some particular daring deed has to be done, and
sink out of sight again when the rewards of
success have been distributed.
</p>

<p>
A few glasses of vodka in advance, and three
silver roubles in prospective, assisted by friendly
pats on the back from his companions, who were
afraid to go themselves, were sufficient encouragements
to animate this man of valour to the heroic
pitch.
</p>

<p>
The villagers set him astride the piece of wood,
and began to lower away; indeed they were in
such a hurry to send him down to the presence
of the Evil One that I began to fear he would be
dropped altogether.
</p>

<p>
However, he arrived at the bottom in safety;
and now was the opportunity for observing, more
clearly and closely, how the diabolic idea had
seized on the popular mind.
</p>

<p>
All were in a rampant state of excitement and
expectation.  The mayor was wondering where
he could lock up the infernal prisoner; in fact,
doubting whether or not he should send to the
nearest town for the assistance of the military.
</p>

<p>
Two or three suggested that I had made a
mistake in not ordering the fire-engines to come,
and many more were speculating upon the
probability of their envoy having been already
devoured by the devil as a return for his
temerity.
</p>

<p>
Presently the rope was shaken, which is the
signal to draw up.  Very gently and very
nervously this operation commences; a good
many of the crowd show signs of running away;
and the men at the windlass maintain that it
turns very heavily.  A few peaceable citizens
suggest that, after all, perhaps the better way
would be not to bring the prisoner up, but to
leave him where he is, with a strong guard
always on the watch to see that he did not pop
up suddenly and set fire to the village; but
seeing that this means only letting go the windlass,
and the poor fellow that is attached to it,
I insist on their proceeding with the winding-up.
</p>

<p>
In time the man's head appeared coming out
of the darkness, and he called out, "I have got
him all right."
</p>

<p>
The peasants then began to think that, after
all, his diabolic majesty was not so awful as
they supposed&mdash;the captive brought to light
proving to be no more than an immense specimen
of the Horned Owl of the Ural Mountains, whose
enormous eyes shone from his ruffled plumage
like two balls of fire.
</p>

<p>
The disappointment was thoroughly real, as, by
the time the affair had finished, the news having
spread, people were arriving from the neighbouring
villages to see the wonderful sight; and as
there was no devil after all, the moujiks did not
think it advisable to ask me to treat them to
vodka all round, which in Russia is a natural
adjunct to the occurrence of anything extraordinary
in a village.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the greatest disappointment was
felt by the poor fellow who made the adventurous
descent.  He, of course, received his three
silver roubles, but he lost the "kudos" for his act
of daring.
</p>

<p>
In answer to the question, "Well, Ivan, how
did you manage it all?" he replied:
</p>

<p>
"Well, Barrin, you see, when I got to the
bottom I saw something blazing; so I shut my
eyes, made a rush at it, and brought it up in my
arms in the best way I could, and here it is."
</p>

<p>
This same owl&mdash;a splendid specimen&mdash;I had
stuffed, and kept facing my writing-table for a
long time afterwards, as a memento of the
Russian peasants' belief in the "Devil and all his
works."

<h3>
A BEAR-HUNT IN RUSSIA.
</h3>

<p>
The Russians are not a sporting people, and
it is only the bear that gives them
anything like a desire for the hunt.
</p>

<p>
If a moujik can only find bruin in his winter
quarters he is happy, as it gives him that which
he loves so much&mdash;a "pot" shot.
</p>

<p>
There are always several peasants in every
neighbourhood who spend the winter in searching
for bear-holes, primarily with the idea of
selling the "find" to some local gentleman, or, if
that fails, of making a few roubles out of the
animal's skin and fat.
</p>

<p>
The operation of searching is difficult, and even
dangerous; the snow is so extremely fine and soft
that walking on it without snow-shoes is impossible,
and these long narrow slips of wood turned
up at the ends, with a piece of leather nailed across
the middle into which to place the feet, are
difficult things to manage.  Going on level ground
is easy enough, but up or down hill the wearer
of them is very apt to tumble; and then with
some three feet of shoe sticking into the snow,
and head and arms deeply plunged by the force
of the fall, extrication is a work of time and
partial suffocation a close probability.
</p>

<p>
"When, therefore," says Mr. Barry in his <i>Ivan
at Home</i>, "we have discovered a bear, we let him
alone until the snow is on the eve of disappearing,
and he can be comfortably approached.  By
that time, also, he will be waking up from his
hibernation, and a little more lively than he
would be if we roused him in the midst of his
winter slumbers.
</p>

<p>
"My greatest adventure in bear-hunting came
about in the following manner.  I was accustomed
to pay a reward of twenty-five roubles to
the man who found me a bear, and this reward
kept my peasants on the look-out.  The first
moujik who, towards the end of a long winter,
came to claim it one fine morning, lived at a
distance of some hours' drive from my house.
We drove over to his village to arrive towards
evening, and sat down to supper in his house,
where the head forester met me.  After supper
we cleared out the moujik and his family, and
settled down, my head forester and I, to sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Hours before daylight we were on our way
to the forest, the snow had begun to melt, and
the road was rough for sledging, especially here
and there when we came to bare places, where
the snow was destroyed by tepid springs, which
are very common in some parts of Russia.
</p>

<p>
"The jolting of the sledge was unpleasant, and
so far the journey was a disagreeable one.  But
the coral magnificence of the ancient forest
compensated for bodily discomfort.  No person of
observation can pass these primeval forests
without discovering wonders at every turn.  The
monster trees&mdash;whose thick trunks and arms are
twisted into fantastic distortions, darken the
road with the thick caverns they form where the
wind has uprooted them by dozens, and they
lean supported by their branches across the
way&mdash;seen in the gray morning as we glide along
our silent path of snow have a solemn and
imposing influence on the mind, like that produced
by the ruins of some grand old temple, whose
foundation, like that of our Russian forest, is
hidden in remote antiquity.
</p>

<p>
"When we left our sledge and took to struggling
through the wood we sank deep in the
snow at every step, and were thoroughly glad to
arrive at last before the winter residence of our
bear.  The air-holes left for breathing purposes
were freshly discoloured, and showed that bruin
was at home, so we got to business without delay.
</p>

<p>
"Shooting a bear as he emerges from his winter
quarters is not unattended with danger, because,
if the shots do not happen to be mortal, the
animal charges, and the men near the hole are
sometimes knocked over and severely injured.
It is very necessary, therefore, that the shooter
should be supported by a man with a spear, who
stands close behind him and receives the bear in
case of need on the point of his weapon.  This
duty can only be intrusted to an old hand, and
one who never flinches.
</p>

<p>
"Besides the gun which the shooter carries in
hand, he must have a second in reserve behind
him, as bears sometimes "take a great deal of
killing."  The battery being supposed to be
arranged, the moujiks begin to call and talk to
the bear.  If this does not move him they insert
a small tree, and literally 'stir him up with a long
pole.'  The animal then (generally in a drowsy
state) puts his head through the opening, and
upon presenting a fair mark is killed.  But if he
is already awake in his hole before the stirring
up process commences he will bolt out with a
rush which is far from agreeable.
</p>

<p>
"On the occasion I am referring to we had
made a mistake in our calculations, for after all
the bear had given us the slip; but we knew
that he could not be far off, as he must only have
left his hole a few minutes before.  We accordingly
separated to hunt him up.  I was walking
among the brushwood with a man behind me
carrying a spare double-barrelled rifle, when I
heard the bear growl, but could not see him;
presently I made him out about thirty or forty
paces off, and looking round to see that my other
gun was near, beheld the fellow carrying it in
the act of making off as fast as he could.  I
caught him up and made him stand, and in the
meantime the bear was slowly advancing towards
us.  There was so much underwood that I could
not see to make a sure shot, but at last was
obliged to fire.  The rifle I had in my hand was
an English Enfield.  I missed the shoulder and
struck the brute in the side.  I found afterwards
that the bullet had gone through him, literally
riddling him.  He took no notice of this beyond
giving a growl.  He then came towards me, when
I took my second gun and fired point-blank at his
forehead; the gun was a smooth-bore and the
bullet round; this also had no effect on him beyond
causing just a shake of his head and another
growl.  I had only one barrel left, and did not
like the situation, as my spearman was hunting
on his own account and had not yet come up;
but I for the first time in my life learned by
experience the full value of a breech-loader, for
I had just time to put a cartridge into the empty
barrel, giving me two more chances, when the
animal was almost close to me.  Stepping aside,
I fired into his heart, and he fell dead at my feet.
</p>

<p>
"This was a lesson to me in the future not to
depend upon myself alone in attempting to kill
a bear."

<h3>
A STORY OF PETER THE GREAT.
</h3>

<p>
Some hundred and fifty years ago the
"Emperor of all the Russias" was Peter the
Great; and Peter, with all his faults, was a
generous-hearted man, and loved an adventure
dearly.  It was a cold bleak day in November
when our story commences, and the fishermen on
the Gulf of Finland could easily foretell a coming
storm from the clouds which were gathering on
the horizon from the south-east.  As the clouds
grew darker, the wind blew in louder gusts, and
the waves rose with whiter and taller crests, and
lashed the shores with an ever-increasing
vehemence.  Along the beach on the north side of the
Gulf of Finland are some twenty or thirty
fishermen's huts, which form part of the straggling
town of Lachta.  Hard by is the spot where a
ferry-boat starts&mdash;or rather started a century
ago&mdash;for the opposite side of the gulf some twice
or three times a week.  As the door of one of
these cottages opened, a young sailor came out,
followed by his mother, who saw that he was
bent on crossing the lake for the purpose of
transacting some business at the little village
of Liborg, and was vainly endeavouring to stay
him by pointing out the signs of the growing
storm.
</p>

<p>
"Only see, my dear son," she cried, "how
rough and angry the lake is now; see what
madness it is to venture out in an open boat
upon its waves on such a day.  If the ferry-boat
must go, let it start without you, and do
you stay at home, my Steenie, for your poor
mother's sake."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! mother," replied the young man, "you
are over-anxious; my business with Carl Wald
compels me to go across whether I like it or not,
and I cannot disappoint him if the ferry-boat
starts at all, and start it will directly from the
quay, for I see the passengers gathering together
at the top of the steps.  Only look now, there is
Alec and Nicholas going across, and I cannot stay
behind.  Then, good-bye, mother, I am off to the
<i>Katharine</i>."  So saying he stepped briskly forward.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Paul, my man," said Steenie to the
old boatman, "here's rather a rough passage
across for us; I suppose you will go all the
same, though you don't seem to like the looks
of the weather a bit better than I do?  But I
don't see any other boats out this afternoon for
certain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Paul!  Oh, Steenie! it is just tempting
Providence to think of crossing over with such a
sea rising, and with the wind almost dead against
you," cried the distracted widow.
</p>

<p>
"As to that, there's always danger afloat,"
answered Paul, "be it fair or foul; and Providence
takes care of us afloat as well as ever he does on
land.  Here, Alec, let go that rope.  Now then,
to your oars.  She's off now, boys!  Helm aport
now."
</p>

<p>
"Port it is," growled the steersman, who
evidently had no fancy for the voyage, and had all
this time been crying out against the unpropitious
state of the weather.
</p>

<p>
The boatmen who were on the steps and along
the beach assured the widow that there was no
real danger; and so having bid her son an
affectionate farewell, and uttering many a devout
prayer for his safe return next week, she went
back into her cottage low and depressed in her
spirits, and sat watching the boat from her
window as it did battle with each crested surge and
rose proudly on its course.  Need we say that she
watched it with a mother's eye, until a projecting
cliff shut it wholly out of sight?  The storm,
however, continued as before, and the mother
had but one resource left, to commit her beloved
son and the frail boat in which he crossed the
waters of the lake to the merciful goodness of
that Providence who is "the God of the
fatherless and the widow."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the little vessel was battling with
the angry waves in a place where there was a
narrow passage, some fifty yards broad, between
two dangerous shelving sandbanks, well known
to the master of the <i>Katharine</i> and his crew.
The sandbanks themselves, as it happened, lay
partly under the lee of one of the little islands
which stud the coast near Lachta; and the
current was bearing strong upon the bank upon
the leeward.  At this moment the <i>Katharine</i>
shipped a large quantity of water; as ill-luck
would have it, the tiller broke, and before the
boat's head could be righted she had drifted
upon the edge of the bar of sand, and there she
stuck fast.  The little bark would have been
overwhelmed by the breakers but for the shelter
afforded by the corner of the island and the
shifting of the wind a point or two round to the
north; indeed she was fast filling with water, in
spite of the efforts of the passengers to keep her
afloat by bailing.  To add to the general
confusion on board, it now turned out that several
of the passengers, who had been drinking at the
village inn before starting from Lachta, were
fairly intoxicated, and the rest were sinking
down bewildered into the apathy of despair, so
that only Stephen and two of the boatmen had
their wits about them.  But though they strove
with all their might, they were unable to move
the boat from off the sandbank.  At this
moment, when the waves were breaking over the
little <i>Katharine</i>, and had already swept off into
deep water one or two hapless passengers, who
had lost all heart and courage, a sail was seen
approaching.
</p>

<p>
It was rather a large vessel, with a gallant
crew of some twenty men, who had been inspecting
a portion of the coast.  They had seen
the perilous position of old Paul and his boat, and
had borne down to his assistance, for in spite of
the terrible raging of the wind and waves the
captain could not see the poor fellows swept
away one by one and drowned without at least
making an effort to save them.
</p>

<p>
The vessel neared the sandbank; but how
may she approach close enough to rescue the
unfortunate fellows on board the <i>Katharine</i>?
A boat is lowered from the vessel, and four as
gallant Russian sailors as ever ploughed the fresh
waters of Ladoga or the Baltic have rowed up to
the spot; but the strength of two of the crew,
added to the exertions of Stephen and the boatmen
of the <i>Katharine</i>, are not sufficient to move
the boat from the firm grasp with which the
sand held her keel.  They were, therefore,
beginning to relax their efforts, when a second
boat, with a crew of six stout-hearted fellows,
neared the bank, and by vigorous efforts reached
the spot in time to reinforce their comrades.
Without the loss of a moment, one of the crew,
a fine tall muscular Russian, some six feet five
inches high, stripped off his outer garments,
leaped into the sea, and after swimming a few
sharp strokes gained a footing on the sand.
This was heavy work indeed, as the sand was
not hard and firm, but mixed with mud and
slime; but the giant strength of the new arrival
turned the scale, and after a few short and sharp
heaves the <i>Katharine</i> moved once more.  In a
few moments she was afloat again, and taken in
tow by the other boat.
</p>

<p>
And where was Stephen all this time?  Worn
out with fatigue and cold, for he had been
immersed some two hours in the chilly waves,
and standing in deep water and nearly exhausted
by their violence, he had lost his footing on the
slippery bank, and having got in a moment
beyond his depth was vainly attempting to keep
his head above water by swimming in his
drenched and dripping clothes, the weight of
which in a few minutes more would have carried
him down.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Steenie, Steenie!" cried the old boatman,
Paul, with a loud voice of agony, which would
make itself heard even above the roaring of the
angry wind and waves; "can none of you
save my poor Stephen, the bravest lad that
ever trod a deck!  He's gone now; and but
for his help this day my boat would have been
lost."
</p>

<p>
"He's not lost yet!" cried the tall seaman; and,
plunging into the waves, he caught him by the
hair of the head just as he was sinking a third
time; the next wave would have carried him
fairly down, and his life would have been gone
beyond recall.
</p>

<p>
It was but the work of a moment for the
strong, tall stranger to swim with the lad
towards the boat, which was hovering near; and
in another second the gallant crew had lifted
him in over the gunwale and laid him at the
bottom of the boat.  As soon as he showed signs
of life, and began to open his eyes, a flask of
brandy was applied to his mouth, and he soon
revived.  The tall man, too, got in, and leaving
two of his crew to help old Paul to tow the
<i>Katharine</i> ashore, he gave the signal to his men,
and they pulled off with all their might in the
direction of Lachta.  Though the waves were
still running high, yet, fortunately, the wind was
astern; so the sharp, quick strokes of the crew
soon brought the boat to a landing-place from
which, a few hours before, poor Stephen had
departed in such high spirits, and with such
confidence in Paul's seamanship and the ability
of the <i>Katharine</i> to make the passage.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the boat came to the sheltered nook
where the steps of the landing-place led up from
the sea, Stephen was put ashore, and partly led
and partly carried he reached the cottage of his
mother.  At the sight of her son the poor
widow burst into a flood of tears, and began
to give way to an agony of joy and grief.  A
warm bath was soon prepared for her son;
and after the application of some gentle restoratives
poor Stephen was able to sit up and thank
his kind preserver, the tall stranger, who, with
his two men behind him, just now lifted up
the latch of the cottage-door and had entered
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed the grateful
mother; "why, sir, you are in wet clothes too!
Sit down, sir, by the fire, and accept of my
humble fare, while I go and find some of my
Steenie's clothes for you to put on, and I dry
those dripping garments."
</p>

<p>
The tall stranger sat down, and, as the widow
left the room, gave his two followers a hint not
to make known to the boy or his mother who he
was.  In a few minutes the stranger had retired,
and assumed a plain old suit belonging to the
young man whose life he had saved, and was
engaged in eating some hot bacon which the
widow had just placed on the table before him,
with many protestations of her eternal gratitude
to the saviour of her son.
</p>

<p>
"May the King of Heaven, who never turns a
deaf ear to the widow's prayer, mercifully reward
you for saving my Steenie's life!  It is not many
a sailor, or merchant either, that would have
done as you did to-day.  Heaven speed you; and
may you never forget that the poor widow of
Lachta is praying for you night and morning,
that the Almighty may increase your store,
whenever you are sailing over the stormy sea, or
the lakes of Onega and Ladoga."
</p>

<p>
The tall stranger was about to rise and depart,
when suddenly the door opened, and a naval
officer entered with a crowd of attendants.  It
was the captain and mate of the barque which
Paul and Steenie had seen in the offing, and
which had sent her boats to the rescue of the
<i>Katharine</i>.
</p>

<p>
"My noble master, may it please your majesty,"
he said, falling on one knee, "the <i>Royal Peter</i>
has come safe, and she has towed the <i>Katharine</i>
too into the little port of Lachta."
</p>

<p>
The poor widow fell down upon her knees
in astonishment, and faltered forth her
apologies for not having recognized his majesty,
and for having treated him with such apparent
disrespect.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, my good woman," said the czar,
smiling, "how could you know the emperor thus
disguised in mud and dirt.  But you will know
him henceforth.  I shall keep your son's clothes
in remembrance of this day; and when your boy
'Steenie,' as you call him, wakes up from the
sound sleep into which he has fallen, tell him
that he will always find a true friend in Peter
Alexovitch."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Our readers when they learn that the foregoing
story is founded upon a plain historical fact&mdash;as
they will find upon reading for themselves the
"Life of Peter the Great,"&mdash;will be grieved to
hear that the noble conduct of the emperor on
this occasion cost him his life.  He had for a long
time suffered under a chronic internal disease,
which none of the court physicians could
effectually combat; and in the month of November,
1724, in which our story is laid, having gone,
contrary to the advice of his physicians, to inspect
the works on Lake Ladoga, his exposure to the
wet and cold, in rescuing the poor ferryman and
his crew in the manner related, affected him
so seriously that he never afterwards recovered.
The emperor went home to his palace at
St. Petersburg without loss of time, but his malady
increased in spite of all the remedies which the
medical skill of Russia could furnish; and
gradually he sank under the disease, till death put an
end to his sufferings towards the close of the
following January.
</p>

<p>
Such was the end of Peter I. of Russia,
deservedly named the "Great;" though he was the
strangest compound of contradictions, perhaps,
that the world has ever seen.  In him the most
ludicrous undertakings were mingled with the
grandest political schemes.  Benevolence and
humanity were as conspicuous in his character as
a total disregard of human life.  He was at once
kind-hearted and severe, even to the extent of
ferocity.  Without education himself he promoted
arts, sciences, and literature.  "He gave," says
one of his biographers, "a polish to his people,
and yet he was himself a savage; he taught them
the art of war, of which, however, he was
himself ignorant; from the sight of a small boat
on the river Moskwa he created a powerful fleet,
and made himself an expert and active shipwright,
sailor, pilot, and commander; he changed
the manners, customs, and laws of the Russians,
and lives in their memory, not merely as the
founder of their empire, but as the father of his
country."
</p>

<p>
Yes; the memory of Peter the Great to this
day is dear among all classes of the Russians,
from the noblest of the Boyards down to the
meanest peasant.  But if among the towns and
villages of his vast empire there be one in which
his name is cherished with especial honour, it is
that little fishing town of Lachta; and in proof of
our assertion we may add, that the cottage in
which "Steenie" and his mother lived and died is
still familiarly known to every traveller in those
parts as "Peter's House."

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
